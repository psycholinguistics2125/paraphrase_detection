Most people start the day by,"Most people start the day by having lunch at a local cafe which has a great menu from all corners of Spain. A classic, with very modern food (chefs and restaurant managers are still doing great work, for example). It is very easy to get into town on foot, though. From your street (not sure if it would make the walk from downtown the right idea, however there are buses and other transport which can get you out of that area, I suggest walking if you can, particularly if your bus or van does run by that bus station and you don't want to hitch, but you must walk! ). The next local restaurant I recommend (that has lots of international menus and can also cook an extraordinary salad) may be just off the main street, about a quarter street to another street which goes straight through town (there is more than just the big bus stop right at the town centre though) which allows you to walk past it.

When I was a little kid,"When I was a little kid, every Friday afternoon was our Saturday school project — reading and writing down a poem and a verse. That was the time I had free to go out in my yard, play, get into fights and make mistakes and write. I started as a kid playing with my sister and she got really bored and took off to work. All my little brothers and sisters would hang on every little action in real life but as she went on work her heart stopped. So they all got together, my dad put up two signs — one on each end, just like they use on cars now where it's got the name on it and then he added the day. When we got home from church she started doing her own job, taking out trash for us.

When I was a little kid,"When I was a little kid, I used to watch a lot of cartoons. And one of the cartoons that I remember watching was ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.""

So he would go out and find Tom and Tom would follow him around and they would play games and stuff like that. But the thing that struck me the most about that cartoon was the way that Tom was treated. He was always treated like he was an animal, and that really struck a chord with me.
